        <p id="paragraph1">Internet is a global communication network which links together other smaller networks or individual computers
         amd helps them to share information between each other. Most people know how to access and use the internet, 
         whether from their phone at work on their home WiFi. But what is the internet? How does the internet actually work?

    <h1>How does the Internet work</h1>
       <img src="/images/web.jpg" alt="This is a web image" class="right">
       <p class="paragraph">In order to access the internet first we need a browser(chrome, mozilla etc.) and an internet connection of course.
        Through the browser we can make requests to different web pages and respond to the data we getting back.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Internet protocols</h2>
        <img src="images/protocol.jpg" alt="protocol image">
        <p class="paragraph" >The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol which helps to find and address packets of data so that they can travel across networks
         and arrive at the correct destination. These data are divided into smaller pieces, called packets.
         IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. </p>

    <h2>Packets</h2>
        <img src="/images/packets.jpg" alt="packets image">
        <p class="paragraph">Everything on the internet, including emails and webpages, makes use of network packets to send information
         between users and recipients. This approach to sending a network packet ensures information reliability
         so that data does not have to be sent as a single large file.
         Each packet sent includes information such as the source and destination, protocols or identification.</p>

    <h2>DNS and IP addresses</h2>
        <img src="/images/dns.png" alt="dns image">
        <p class="paragraph">The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names. 
         Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
         DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
         Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 
         DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses</p>

    <h2>Routers</h2>
        <img src="/images/router.jpg" alt="router image">
        <p class="paragraph">A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.
         It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, 
         and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.</p>
